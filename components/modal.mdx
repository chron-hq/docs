The Chron API is organized around [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [JSON-encoded](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

The Chron API doesn't support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.
