The Chron API uses Bearer Authentication to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your Access Token in the Chron Dashboard.

Your Access Token carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure! The Access Token acts as a digital key, granting authorized users access to the API resources while ensuring data security. Do not share your secret Access Token in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

Provide your Access Token via Bearer Auth (e.g., for a cross-origin request), use `-H "Authorization: Bearer your_access_token"`.

All API requests must be made over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
